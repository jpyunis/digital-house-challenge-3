# Music Genre Recognition

Music genres are categories that have arisen through a complex interplay of cultures, artists, and market forces to characterize similarities between compositions and organize music collections.


## Data

The FMA aims to overcome this hurdle by providing 917 GiB and 343 days of Creative Commonslicensed audio from 106,574 tracks from 16,341 artists and 14,854 albums, arranged in a hierarchical taxonomy of 161 genres. It provides full-length and high-quality audio, pre-computed features, together with track- and user-level metadata, tags, and free-form text such as biographies.

- tracks.csv: per track metadata such as ID, title, artist, genres, tags and play counts, for all 106,574 tracks.
- genres.csv: all 163 genres with name and parent (used to infer the genre hierarchy and top-level genres).
- features.csv: common features extracted with librosa.
- echonest.csv: audio features provided by Spotify for a subset of 13,129 tracks.

## Setup

1. Download project with 
`git clone https://github.com/[username]/digital-house-challenge-3.git`
    - To update changes from GH into local repo: 
        `git pull origin master`
    - Save local changes to github with:
        `git add [filenames]`
        `git commit -m '[Commit message]'`
        `Git push origin master`
2. Download fma dataset [fma_metadata.zip](https://os.unil.cloud.switch.ch/fma/fma_metadata.zip) in data/ folder
3. Python environment used: dhdsblend
    - To activate run `conda activate dhdsblend`
4. Install additional python libraries `pip install -r requirements.txt`


To use Spotify API, create file named 'config.ini' with the following information:

```
[SPOTIFY]
username = 
scope = user-read-private user-read-playback-state user-modify-playback-state
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID = 
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET = 
SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI = https://google.com.ar
```

### Additional Python libraries

1. [Spotipy](https://spotifypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
Spotify.py is a modern, friendly, and Pythonic API library for the Spotify API.

2. [Librosa](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html)
It is a Python module to analyze audio signals in general but geared more towards music.
